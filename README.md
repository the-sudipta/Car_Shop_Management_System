 ## :star2: About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://source.unsplash.com/random/1920x1080)

This project is a comprehensive car dealership management system designed for sellers, allowing them to 
efficiently manage and operate their inventory through an integrated web platform. Upon logging in from the 
login page, which includes a registration option, sellers are directed to their personalized homepage. Here, 
they can showcase new, used, and rental cars, with functionalities to add or remove vehicles from each category. 
Additionally, sellers have the capability to manage existing listings by editing car prices and quantities, as 
well as halting the sale of any vehicle currently available on the site. The system also provides powerful 
reporting tools, enabling sellers to generate detailed PDF reports on monthly or yearly sales, revenue, and 
profit across new, used, and rental car transactions. This robust solution aims to streamline the selling 
process, offering a seamless and user-friendly interface for car dealership management.
